## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled, unlike absolute which is relative to its closest assestor with positio relative.


```css
.loader {
    position: fixed;
}
```

### Continued development

Ill focus on creating more animations. Thanks to @caroline for the awesome animation.
